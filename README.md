# Rust Json Parser (r-jparser)
This program is a simple json parser to learn about parsing techniques.Parsing is often broken up into two stages: lexical analysis and syntactic analysis. Lexical analysis is the process of dividing a sequence of characters into meaningful chunks, called tokens. Syntactic analysis (which is also sometimes referred to as parsing) is the process of analysing the list of tokens to match it to a formal grammar.

## Features
- **Command-line Interface**: Allows users to pass json file through command-line arguments.
- **Proper Error**: Shows where the error occured.
- **Modular Design**: Each component of the application is isolated in its own module, promoting easier maintenance and scalability.
